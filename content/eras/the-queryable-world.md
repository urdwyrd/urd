Surveyed the landscape, locked the spec, formalised the grammar, proved the compiler, and built a semantic layer that powers diagnostics, visualisation, diffing, language services, and AI tooling. 626 tests across three crates. The FactSet — six tuple types extracted in a single deterministic pass — is the foundation everything else composes over.
