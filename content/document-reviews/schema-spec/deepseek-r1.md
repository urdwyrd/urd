Score: 9/10 Comprehensive and internally consistent. The containment model (one spatial primitive) is the kind of simplifying insight that makes a whole system work. The determinism contract with seed propagation rules is production-ready thinking. The coverage matrix showing exactly what's tested is a nice touch. Could be stronger on explaining why YAML-like frontmatter but not YAML—the constraints are justified but the reader needs convincing. The any: OR condition spec is clear and implementable.
