Score: 9.5 out of 10
A solid foundation defining a clear, extensible world model with strong principles around containment, visibility, and declarative structure. The contract between authoring and runtime is explicit and durable. Complexity is justified by ambition, and extension paths are well planned. Excellent technical core.
