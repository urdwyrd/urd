Score: 8/10 Raw, credible, and useful. The integration tax (30–50% of dev effort) is a devastating number. Disco Elysium breaking articy:draft is the kind of concrete failure mode that justifies a whole product category. The "writer editing dialogue in Excel" quote will stick with readers. Could be stronger on quantification—how many sources per pain point? The severity matrix is a good start but the time cost estimates feel unsubstantiated.
