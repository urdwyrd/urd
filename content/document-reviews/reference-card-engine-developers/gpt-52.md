Score: 9 out of 10
Highly practical integration guide that lowers adoption friction for engine teams. Concise yet comprehensive coverage of schema structure and runtime expectations. Good emphasis on determinism and contracts. Some integrators may still need deeper examples, but as a quick reference it is strong and usable.
