Score: 9/10 Information density done right. Everything an engine integrator needs, nothing they don't. The containment model table (pick up/drop/give all as move) is the kind of clarification that saves hours of confusion. The stable ID derivation rules are exactly what implementers need to know. Missing: error code reference (what does URD001 mean?). The coverage table at the end is a nice touch but might be better in its own document.
