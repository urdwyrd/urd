Score: 8/10 This is the ultimate "cheat sheet" for implementation. It strips away the dense normative language of the spec and gives engineers exactly what they need: the eight top-level blocks and a clear feature-support checklist. The "v1 Boundaries" section is especially helpful for preventing scope creep during the initial integration phase. It’s an efficient, high-utility document for the developer who just wants to start coding.
