Score: 8/10 Thoughtful and thorough. The line between syntactic validity (phase 1) and semantic correctness (phases 2–4) is drawn precisely. The error recovery strategy (synchronisation points, partial ASTs) shows real-world LSP awareness. The positive/negative corpus distinction is well-handled. A bit heavy on PEG mechanics for a brief—some readers will want the grammar, not the grammar-about-the-grammar. But for its audience (compiler implementers), it's exactly right.
