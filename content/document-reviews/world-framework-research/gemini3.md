An academic-grade landscape analysis that provides the "intellectual backbone" for the entire project. It goes beyond a simple feature comparison, identifying a systemic "missing middle" between narrative-only tools and simulation-heavy game engines. The identification of the "fragmentation tax" is a compelling value proposition that resonates with professional developers. The risk assessment is sober and professional, proving that this isn't just a passion project, but a calculated response to a real market gap in the industry.
