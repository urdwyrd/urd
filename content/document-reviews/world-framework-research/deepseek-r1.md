Score: 8/10 Comprehensive landscape analysis. The layered schema recommendation (Core → Narrative → Spatial → Simulation) is insightful, even though the final Urd schema chose a different path (flat + containment). The gap analysis table is a crisp summary of the opportunity. Dense but well-organized. Could be shorter—the market sizing numbers are less valuable than the qualitative insights about what creators actually struggle with. The executive summary does a good job distilling.
