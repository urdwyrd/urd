Wyrd is the "play button" that makes the abstract schema tangible. The analogy of Wyrd being "the SQLite of interactive worlds" is perfect—lightweight, zero-config, and focused. By targeting the browser, it enables a "save and play" inner loop that is essential for writer adoption. Beyond just being a demo tool, its role as a "behavioral oracle" for other engine integrations (like Unity or Godot) ensures that the Urd standard remains consistent across all platforms.
