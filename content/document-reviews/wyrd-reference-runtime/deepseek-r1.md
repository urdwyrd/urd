Score: 9/10 Clean, focused, and appropriately scoped. The three-layer architecture (Core/Presentation/Extension) is the right separation. The "canonical behaviour rule" (Wyrd resolves spec ambiguity) is exactly what a reference implementation needs. The three deployment contexts (urd.world/IDE/CI) show genuine product thinking. The API surface is minimal and sufficient. Could use more detail on the event types and their payloads—that's what integrators will need to know.
