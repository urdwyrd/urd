An excellent exploration of the hardest authoring problem, balancing writer usability with compiler determinism. Comparative analysis against existing systems is convincing, and pattern decomposition is practical. The document clearly explains tradeoffs and grounds final decisions in real workflow needs. Slight risk remains in extreme depth scenarios, but the reasoning and direction are highly solid.
