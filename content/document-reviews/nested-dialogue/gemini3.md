Score: 9/10 This document successfully solves the highest-risk usability problem in the framework. It acknowledges that writers will abandon a tool if it can’t handle complex branching as elegantly as ink. The "hybrid approach" described here—balancing scannability with deterministic JSON output—is a brilliant compromise. It provides the necessary "why" behind the syntax, making the eventual specification much easier to trust and implement.
