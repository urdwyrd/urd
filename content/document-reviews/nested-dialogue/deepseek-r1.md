Score: 9/10 Exemplary design rationale. The hybrid model (indentation for shallow branches, sections for deep structure) is the right answer to a genuinely hard problem. The stress test (interrogation scene) proves it works at production complexity. The "what this exercises" section is particularly valuable. The historical note about the compiled JSON shape change shows healthy documentation discipline. One of the strongest design explorations in the set.
