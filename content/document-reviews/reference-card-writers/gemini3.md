Score: 10/10 The most important document for user adoption. It brilliantly simplifies the system into "The Seven Symbols" and "Quick Patterns." The philosophy stated—"If you need to learn the schema to do your job, the tooling has failed"—is exactly what narrative designers need to hear. It empowers writers to focus on storytelling rather than JSON structures, making the framework feel like a creative tool rather than an engineering chore.
