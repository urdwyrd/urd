Score: 9.5 out of 10
Exceptionally approachable for writers, with minimal cognitive load and clear examples. The seven symbol system is intuitive and reinforces prose first authoring. It strongly supports the promise that writers need not learn engineering concepts. Very effective onboarding artifact.
