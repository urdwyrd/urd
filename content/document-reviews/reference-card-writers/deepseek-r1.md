Score: 9/10 The seven symbols table should be on a t-shirt. The "what you don't need to know" section is psychologically wise—writers need permission to ignore parts of the system. The quick pattern reference at the end is genuinely useful. The only miss: the example file at the top uses + and * but doesn't explain them until later. A tiny annotation would help. Otherwise, pitch-perfect for the audience.
