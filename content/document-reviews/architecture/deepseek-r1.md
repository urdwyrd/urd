Score: 9/10 A masterfully structured blueprint. The pipeline architecture with .urd.json as the central contract is clean and well-reasoned. The phased build order shows real engineering discipline. Risk register adds credibility. Slightly light on concrete performance benchmarks for the 200ms LSP target, but the compiler profiling recommendation addresses this. The component boundaries are crisp and independently replaceable—exactly what a normative architecture doc should be.
