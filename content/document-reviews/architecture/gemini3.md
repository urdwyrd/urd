Score: 9/10 This is a masterfully organized blueprint. It avoids the common mistake of building a monolith, instead opting for a clean, modular "pipeline" architecture. By defining the .urd.json file as the central contract, it ensures that compilers and runtimes can evolve independently. The build-order logic is pragmatic, prioritizing the compiler to unblock all other development. It is an essential, high-clarity document for any engineer on the project.
