Score: 9.5 out of 10
A strong, implementation ready blueprint with clear component boundaries, data flow, and build sequencing. The separation between compiler, runtime, testing, and tooling is exceptionally clear, enabling parallel development. Diagnostics, incremental compilation, and contract discipline show production awareness. Minor risk lies in implementation complexity and the need for strict discipline across teams, but overall this is mature and highly actionable.
