Score: 8/10 Disciplined forward planning. The lambda function design is thoughtful—read-only state in, effects out preserves the event sourcing model. Smart to reserve ~~ for owner visibility now. The OR condition promotion note is a nice touch, showing the doc as a living artifact. Would benefit from more concrete timelines or version targeting (v2? v3?). Lacks discussion of migration paths for worlds that might eventually use these features.
