Score: 9 out of 10
Well scoped forward looking concepts that extend the system without contaminating v1. The lambda model preserves determinism and auditability while enabling expressive logic. Clear separation between speculative and normative features prevents scope creep. Some proposals will need careful sandbox and performance validation later, but the architectural foresight is excellent.
