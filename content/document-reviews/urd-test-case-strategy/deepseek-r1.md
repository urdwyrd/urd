Score: 9/10 Tests as proof, not just verification—this is the right philosophy. The four test cases are well-chosen, each validating a distinct slice of the schema. The coverage table showing what's exercised (and crucially, what's not) is honest and useful. The Wyrd API surface for testing is cleanly specified. The only gap: no discussion of performance testing or stress testing beyond the interrogation scene. How does the system behave at 10,000 sections?
