This strategy brilliantly treats tests as "proof of correctness" rather than just a bug-finding exercise. Using classic puzzles like the Monty Hall problem to validate emergent probability proves that the declarative model can handle complex logic. The decision to make tests structured JSON (data, not code) is a masterstroke, keeping validation accessible to narrative designers. It ensures that if the tests pass, the schema isn't just "bug-free"—it’s functionally capable of supporting deep, interactive storytelling.
