Score: 9/10 Compelling and cohesive. The USB-C for narrative data metaphor lands. The phased approach (Monty Hall → Key Puzzle → Dialogue) is credible and test-driven. The AI native by design positioning is smart—not building for AI but ensuring AI can build for you. The competitive positioning table is brutally honest about gaps. Slightly optimistic about the "30–50% glue code" claim being immediately addressable, but that's vision documents' job.
