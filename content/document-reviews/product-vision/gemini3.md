Score: 9/10 This is a high-level strategic triumph. It perfectly frames Urd as the "HTML for interactive worlds," separating intent from realization. The "Strategic Horizon" is particularly compelling, showing a clear path from solving indie developer glue-code problems to becoming the foundation for AI-realized environments. It effectively communicates a massive scope while keeping the immediate goals grounded and achievable.
