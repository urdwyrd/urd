Score: 10/10 The crown jewel of the documentation set. The hybrid dialogue model is fully specified, the seven symbols are exhaustively documented, the import resolution rules are locked down, and the stable ID derivation is future-proof. The ink comparison table is honest about tradeoffs. The "writer promises" section sets correct expectations. The only improvement would be a quick reference appendix, but that's what the writer reference card is for. Normative and complete.
