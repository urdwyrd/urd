Eighteen days from empty repository to: a declarative schema language with formal grammar, a six-phase Rust compiler (8,189 lines, 634 tests, 74 diagnostics), a queryable semantic analysis layer (FactSet IR, LSP, MCP server), a WASM playground with 25 semantic reference kinds, a documentation website with six interactive islands, 27 design documents, and an 88-view desktop IDE built in two days from architecture specification. Almost entirely AI-generated code. Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 represent a phase shift. The project will likely be parked as a historical record. Every brief is public. The challenge is open: one-shot the entire project from the specifications.
