title: Formal grammar brief complete
date: "2026-02-15"
---

The locked prose specifications have been translated into a formal PEG grammar design — a machine-readable definition of valid Schema Markdown. A detailed execution brief covers package structure, parser tooling (Rust/pest), a twelve-file validation corpus extracted from the spec examples, and resolutions for every ambiguity identified during the translation. This is the bridge from design to implementation: the first code package in the monorepo, and the foundation the compiler will be built on.
