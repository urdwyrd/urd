The reference manual catches up with seven compiler releases. Updated from v0.1.7 (554 tests, 69 diagnostics, five phases) to v0.1.14 (634 tests, 74 diagnostics, six phases). New sections cover the ANALYZE phase and its five novel FactSet-derived diagnostics, the semantic diff engine with CLI subcommands, the DefinitionIndex for IDE integration, and full CLI reference. The schema language and JSON format are unchanged — all updates are on the compiler's tooling surface.
