All 32 acceptance criteria verified and documented. Nine compiler requirements, eight static analysis checks, eight FactSet IR requirements, and seven specification consistency items — every one passed or resolved. The cross-document audit found and fixed a latent schema divergence in `on_exhausted` goto handling. Compiler 0.1.7. 554 tests. The gate is closed. Pre-alpha begins.
