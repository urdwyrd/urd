Live test dashboard on the homepage — 302 tests across seven phases, 100% pass rate, with expandable phase breakdowns, architecture compliance checks, and per-file compilation benchmarks. Generated from `cargo test` output on every deploy. The compiler is not a claim; it is a number you can verify.
