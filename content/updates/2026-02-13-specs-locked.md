The full V1 design specification and V0.1 Schema Markdown spec have been finalised and independently reviewed by four frontier AI models — Gemini 3, GPT-5.2, DeepSeek-V3.2, and Grok. All four rated the suite ready for implementation. The schema contract, authoring format, and runtime architecture are now locked as the foundation for the build phase.
