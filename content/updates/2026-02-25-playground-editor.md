The playground code editor is now a FactSet-powered semantic tool mirroring the Rust-side LSP. 25 reference kinds in the cursor resolver — tooltips draw from the compiler's queryable semantic graph for real containment chains, read/write counts, and enum validation rather than static documentation. Inline diagnostics, autocomplete, go-to-definition, and full syntax coverage including the `!` blocked message marker. Also adds a video introduction lightbox on the homepage.
