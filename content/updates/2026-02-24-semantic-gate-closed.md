Six briefs, three tiers, one gate — closed. Novel FactSet diagnostics (SF-1A), PropertyDependencyIndex (SF-2), graph visualisation (SF-3), semantic diff engine (SF-4), LSP server with diagnostics/go-to-def/hover/autocomplete (SF-5), and an eight-tool MCP server for AI agents (SF-6). Compiler 0.1.13. 626 tests across three crates. The queryable world is complete. The runtime gate (Wyrd) is next.
