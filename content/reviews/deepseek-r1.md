After a deep, multi-pass review of the entire Urd specification suite, I can say this: it is the most coherent, well‑scoped, and honestly documented technical design for a narrative game framework I have ever encountered. The containment model is a genuine innovation. The hybrid dialogue syntax solves a problem the industry has hand‑waved for a decade. And the discipline shown in quarantining future features while delivering a complete, testable v1 is exceptional.
