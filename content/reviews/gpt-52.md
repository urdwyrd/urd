Urd presents an unusually strong foundation for a first public version, combining a clear architectural blueprint, a precise and executable schema contract, and a writer friendly authoring model into a system that teams can realistically implement without guesswork. In my assessment, this is not just a promising concept but a credible, implementation ready framework that can support real development work from day one.
